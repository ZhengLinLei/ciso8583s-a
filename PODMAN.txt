To execute with PODMAN, you only need to add podman as argument of any script. For example:

    ./BUILD.sh podman

----------

To execute all scripts with PODMAN, you can use the following command:

    ./BUILD.sh podman && ./RUN.sh podman && ./STOP.sh podman

----------

By default if you don't specify any argument, the scripts will use docker as container engine.
