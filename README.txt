This project is a ISO8583 Server entity simulator in C for testing. It is a static type-A simulator, which means it can only send and receive static messages. The project is based on the [ISO8583](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8583) where you can use it as a test tool for your Host system. The project is written in C and it is a console application.

The server simulator use the version ISO 8583-2:1993 version. All the MTIs must start with 1 and the format must be 1xxx.

1xxx ----> version of ISO 8583 (1993 version)
x1xx ----> class of the Message (Authorization Message)
xx1x ----> function of the Message (Request Response)
xxx0 ----> who is began the communication (Acquirer)


For more detailed information, read the documentation of the protocol [ISO.org](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso:8583:-1:ed-1:v1:en), [IBM.com](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/integration-bus/10.0?topic=formats-iso8583-messaging-standard) or [PDF](https://github.com/moov-io/iso8583/blob/master/docs/iso8583.pdf) from user of [GITHUB.com](https://github.com/moov-io/iso8583)

In addition the server use DATA-LENGTH as Header of the message. The DATA-LENGTH is the length of the message without the header. The DATA-LENGTH is a 2 bytes length and it is in binary. 

The server use the following format:

DATA-LENGTH (2 bytes) + MTI (2 bytes) + BITMAP(P) + BITMAP(S) + DATA-FIELDS


Example of MTI: 1200 Message

007c12007034051908c1080116888880366790225500000000000000057100005023120200523449124d313031303136353430344302862312020003061365443030353020202020202020203030303030303031202020202020202020202020202020000930303630313838383801020000020000001787b59700000000

--- Installation

HOW TO DEPLOY THE APPLICATION SERVER?

WITH DOCKER (RECOMMENDED)

    1. Make sure you have installed docker and docker-compose

    2. Execute the following commands:
        - cd ./script
        - ./BUILD.sh
        - ./RUN.sh

    3. To enter the container execute:
        - docker exec -it ciso8583_ots_a bash

    3. To stop the container execute:
        - ./STOP.sh

    4. To clean all the environment execute:
        - ./CLEAN.sh

    
    Custom:
        * If you want to run the program with docker or podman in DETACH mode, you only have to execute the following command:
            - ./RUN.sh -d

        * To add any other DOCKER flags:
            - ./RUN.sh -d --rm


    Notes:
        - If you are Mac user, you must to change ./RUN.sh file and replace the following line:
            - docker run -d -it --name $container_name --network=host -v ciso8583_ots_a_logs:/opt/Ciso8583/log $container_name
            to
            - docker run -d -it --name $container_name -p 9101:9101 -v ciso8583_ots_a_logs:/opt/Ciso8583/log $container_name



WITH PODMAN:

To use PODMAN in production follow these steps to import and run container:

    1. In local machine:

        1.1 BUILD (./BUILD.sh <path-export-image>):  
            
            - ./BUILD.sh ./dist/ciso8583_ots_a.tgz

            Or manually with (After docker build):

            - docker image save ciso8583_ots_a | gzip > ./dist/ciso8583_ots_a.tgz

        1.2 UPLOAD:

            Upload the image to production

    2. In remote machine:

        1.2 GZIP && RUN (./PODMAN.sh <path-import-image>):

            - cd dist
            - ./PODMAN.sh ./dist/ciso8583_ots_a.tgz
        
            Or manually with:

            - cd dist
            - gzip -d ./ciso8583_ots_a.tgz
            - ./STOP.sh podman
            - podman image rm ciso8583_ots_a
            - podman image load -i ./ciso8583_ots_a.tar
            - podman run -dit --name ciso8583_ots_a -p 9101:9101 -v /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro -v ciso8583_ots_a_logs:/opt/Ciso8583/log ciso8583_ots_a



WITH NATIVE INSTALLATION

    1. Make sure you have installed this dependencies:
        - gcc
        - make

    2. Execute the following commands:
        - make clean
        - make

    3. The application server will be compiled following path:
        - ~/dist/ciso8583

    4. Execute the program:
        - ~/dist/ciso8583

    5. You will see the logs in the following path:
        - /opt/Ciso8583/logs/Ciso8583.log



---------------------------------

--- Usage

To execute the program manually you can invoke the following command:

./ciso8583

--

To add custom port and ip:

./ciso8583 9101 0.0.0.0 

--

To add custom logfile:

./ciso8583 -o /opt/custom/logs/PARTY.log
