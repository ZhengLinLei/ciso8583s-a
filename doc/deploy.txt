--- Installation

HOW TO DEPLOY THE APPLICATION SERVER?

WITH DOCKER (RECOMMENDED)

    1. Make sure you have installed docker and docker-compose

    2. Execute the following commands:
        - cd ./script
        - ./BUILD.sh
        - ./RUN.sh

    3. To enter the container execute:
        - docker exec -it ciso8583_ots_a bash

    3. To stop the container execute:
        - ./STOP.sh

    4. To clean all the environment execute:
        - ./CLEAN.sh

    
    Custom:
        * If you want to run the program with docker or podman in DETACH mode, you only have to execute the following command:
            - ./RUN.sh -d

        * To add any other DOCKER flags:
            - ./RUN.sh -d --rm


    Notes:
        - If you are Mac user, you must to change ./RUN.sh file and replace the following line:
            - docker run -d -it --name $container_name --network=host -v ciso8583_ots_a_logs:/opt/Ciso8583/log $container_name
            to
            - docker run -d -it --name $container_name -p 9101:9101 -v ciso8583_ots_a_logs:/opt/Ciso8583/log $container_name



WITH PODMAN:

To use PODMAN in production follow these steps to import and run container:

    1. In local machine:

        1.1 BUILD (./BUILD.sh <path-export-image>):  
            
            - ./BUILD.sh ./dist/ciso8583_ots_a.tgz

            Or manually with (After docker build):

            - docker image save ciso8583_ots_a | gzip > ./dist/ciso8583_ots_a.tgz

        1.2 UPLOAD:

            Upload the image to production

    2. In remote machine:

        1.2 GZIP && RUN (./PODMAN.sh <path-import-image>):

            - cd dist
            - ./PODMAN.sh ./dist/ciso8583_ots_a.tgz
        
            Or manually with:

            - cd dist
            - gzip -d ./ciso8583_ots_a.tgz
            - ./STOP.sh podman
            - podman image rm ciso8583_ots_a
            - podman image load -i ./ciso8583_ots_a.tar
            - podman run -dit --name ciso8583_ots_a -p 9101:9101 -v /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro -v ciso8583_ots_a_logs:/opt/Ciso8583/log ciso8583_ots_a



WITH NATIVE INSTALLATION

    1. Make sure you have installed this dependencies:
        - gcc
        - make

    2. Execute the following commands:
        - make clean
        - make

    3. The application server will be compiled following path:
        - ~/dist/ciso8583

    4. Execute the program:
        - ~/dist/ciso8583

    5. You will see the logs in the following path:
        - /opt/Ciso8583/logs/Ciso8583.log



---------------------------------

--- Usage

To execute the program manually you can invoke the following command:

./ciso8583

--

To add custom port and ip:

./ciso8583 9101 0.0.0.0 

--

To add custom logfile:

./ciso8583 -o /opt/custom/logs/PARTY.log



---------------------------------


If you want to export directly to production or you want to execute the server in localhost, call script:

    - ./RUNALL.sh
